      <p>
        Dilu Dora is where I share my recipes that I&apos;ve learnt over the
        years.These recipes are mainly from my mother, as she makes some{" "}
        <em>meaaaaaan</em> dishes ðŸ”¥.
        <br />
        No in reality I created this page just to keep track of every recipes,
        how to make them and stuff, so I don&apos;t have to call my mom every
        time I want to make something... and also polish my web development
        skills.
