      <p>
        Dilu Dora is where I share my recipes that I've learnt over the years.
        These recipes are mainly from my mother, as she makes some{" "}
        <em>meaaaaaan</em> dishes ðŸ”¥.
        <br />
        No in reality I created this page just to keep track of every recipes,
        how to make them and stuff, so I don't have to call my mom every time I
        want to make something... and also polish my web development skills.
      </p>
